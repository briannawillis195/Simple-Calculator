<b>Tech Used</b>: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

<b>Lessons Learned</b>: Javascript can literally do magical things. I had no idea the limit that I could take it to as far as being able to use arithmetic. By adding type=number to the input field in HTML, the numbers that can be used in the equations are limitless.
